Tukui API

This is how another addon imports the Tukui engine:
(it must be a top of every lua file if your addon or edited version is built around Tukui)	
	local T, C, L = unpack(Tukui)


Now the functions:

	frame:SetTemplate("Template", texture)
		Set a backdrop that cover the exact size of the frame according 
		to which template we choose. If texture is set to true, it will
		use media.normTex instead of default blank texture. If "" is empty, 
		it will use "Default" template by default.

	frame:CreatePanel("Template", width, height, point, anchor, relativepoint, xposition, yposition)
		SetTemplate brother, set a backdrop with more options like custom 
		size, position, point, etc. If "" is empty, it will use "Default" 
		template by default.
		
	frame:Size(width, height)
		Sets the width and height of object to an absolute (pixel perfect) value 
		in pixels. If height is ommitted then height = width is assumed.
		
	frame:Point(...)	
		Exactly the same as it's little brother SetPoint, but every offset 
		is scaled to absolute (pixel perfect) pixel amounts.
		
	frame:Width(...)
		Exactly the same as it's little brother SetWidth, but every offset 
		is scaled to absolute (pixel perfect) pixel amounts.
	
	frame:Height(...)
		Exactly the same as it's little brother SetHeight, but every offset 
		is scaled to absolute (pixel perfect) pixel amounts.
		
	frame:CreateShadow("Template")
		Create shadow effect on edge of the frame according to which template 
		we choose. If "" is empty, it will use "Default" template by default.
		
	frame:Kill()
		Unregister all events from this frame and kill his process for ever.
		
	frame:StyleButton(hasChecked)
		Set a hover / pushed / and... Checked texture (if set on true)
		

Templates:
	- "Default"
		-- use default color according to what we have set via /media/medias.lua
	- "Transparent"
		-- Same as "Default" but with Transparent background
	- "Tukui"
	- "ClassColor"
	- "Elv"
	- "Eclipse"
	- "Dajova"
	- "Hydra"
	- "Duffed"
